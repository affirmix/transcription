<html><head></head><body><h1 class="public">View</h1><p><p>This class is the base view in TungstenJS. It provides a simple template property that can be overridden, and a render function that will chain any deferred responses.</p>

<p>This view utilizes very basic template literals that are native to ECMAScript 6. This view is intended to be extended for use with other templating systems, for example <code>EJSView</code>, <code>MustacheView</code>, and <code>UnderscoreView</code> that are under development.</p></p><h3>Inheritance Hierarchy</h3><p>Object</p><h2 id="#method-classReference" class="static getter">classReference</h2><p><p>This returns a reference that whatever the top-most sub-class is, which comes in handy when managing instances in static functions on classes that are designed to be extended.</p></p><h3>Properties</h3><table><tr id="#method-classReference-param-undefined"><td>static</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr id="#method-classReference-param-classReference"><td>property</td><td>classReference</td><td>Class</td><td>Reference to the current class</td></tr></table><h2 id="#method-classReference" class="getter">classReference</h2><p><p>This returns a reference that whatever the top-most sub-class is, which comes in handy when managing instances in static functions on classes that are designed to be extended.</p></p><h3>Properties</h3><table><tr id="#method-classReference-param-classReference"><td>property</td><td>classReference</td><td>Class</td><td>Reference to the current class</td></tr></table><h2 id="#method-template" class="static">template</h2><p><p>This function is called by the render function, providing with the data that is returned from the resolved promise object.
